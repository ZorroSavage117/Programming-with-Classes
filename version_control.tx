You asked "What is version control and why is it important?" Well version control to thoose who don't know 
in simple terms is a way of keeping past versions of code around to see what is new and see well this worked 
then why is it not working now. In more precise words it is a way to see the changes and older version of 
ones code. The beggist benefit of version control is that it alows you to back up your code and see the 
evolution of your code. Version control can be used if you lost your most resent made code for some unknown 
reason so others can still use your product and alows you to rebuild the code you lost with less effort
because you are not starting from scracht.
